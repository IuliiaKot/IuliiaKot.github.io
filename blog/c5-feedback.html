    <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
    <h4>June 19, 2015</h4>
    <h5>Pairing</h5>
    <p>Pair programming has always been for me the most difficult part. So every time I have to put maximum effort. But in any case it is good practice, it is another view of the problem and more ideas how to solve the problem. Or sometimes it is an opportunity to explain something, and then test your knowledge.</p>
    <h5>Feedback</h5>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
        <p>Every time I read a review like the other partner would work with me I have different feelings. I can not say that pleasant and I do not always agree, but it gives me the opportunity to improve themselves.</p>
        <li>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
        <p> Every review I was very useful.</p>
        <li>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>
        <p>I read the reviews and start to analyze their actions, trying to understand what went wrong and how I can fix it</p>
        <li>How was it to write feedback?</li>
        <p>Write a review very difficult. As a rule I do not know what to write.</p>
        <li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>
        <p>The most difficult thing is to write a good review, which could give the other person the idea of something better, if there is a need for this.</p>
      </ul>
