      By the model Anthony F. Gregorc my thinkind style Abstaract Random, which means:
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. <strong><i>"It is not always what it seems."</i></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Random:</strong> Lets your mind organize information by <strong><i>chunks</i></strong>, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.</p>

        I don't know it is true or not, but what I can say. Random feature completely about me. Sometimes I find it difficult to approach the problem from the beginning. I'm starting to make its parts in any order, and only then try to merge. Of course this doesn't always work, moreover I'm trying to simultaneously work on multiple tasks or to try multiple paths solution. And at such moments to get to work itself only on one task and follow the chosen path is very difficult.

       Almost half of the zero phase behind. It wasn't very difficult. Just a lot of exercises when we should write what we learned. Actually it's good approach which show our progress. But for me it was the hardest part.
