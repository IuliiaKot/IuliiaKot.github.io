      Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's goo habit use version control what multiple people or just one working on a project. A primitive way of version control which a lot people use is to copy files into another directory. This approach is simple, but there are a lot of ways to make mistake.

    <p>
        Git is system for version control of files that was created by Linus Trovalds. It allows you to easily store, update and manage versions of files. Git provides the ability to update and edit the project files to reflect changes made by others. Every time you commit or save the changes of your project, Git makes duplicates of the original file. Developers use git and other version control system because they allow to see the changes made by other developers, easily roll back changes and convenient operation via the command line. In turn, Github is the largest web hosting service for IT projects based on the version control system Git. So if Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface
