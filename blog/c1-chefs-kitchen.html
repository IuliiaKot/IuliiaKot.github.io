  <h1>Impressions of DBC</h1>
  <h4>May 23, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      First week in DBC done. The time to take stock.

      Couple months ago I decided to find school for improving my knowledge and finally finished what I started many years ago. There are a lot of schools. Almost all of them have very similar program(lecture, pair programming, solo project). But when I started to read more precisely I saw that DBC has a bunch of differences. I have some background in CS, but it turned out that almost three years ago I moved to live in USA. Since I started learning English only here, I had problems with communication. That's why I was trying to find a school which not just improving my knowledge and skills but also help me be more social.

    <p>
      And DBC is just such a place.They have a different approach to learning. It's not only about build web development skills but also develop essential non-technical skills like empathy, listening, relationship-building, and leadership that will make you invaluable to dynamic, highly collaborative teams.

      It is important to remember that you cannot just sit back and say "teach me". You must want to learn.
