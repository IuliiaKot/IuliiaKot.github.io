    <h1>Impressions of DBC</h1>
    <h4>May 23, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      First week in DBC done. The time to take stock.

      Couple months ago I decided to find school for improving my knowledge and finally finished what I started many years ago. There are a lot of schools. Almost all of them have very similar program(lecture, pair programming, solo project). But when I started to read more precisely I saw that DBC has a bunch of differences. I have some background in CS, but it turned out that almost three years ago I moved to live in USA. Since I started learning English only here, I had problems with communication. That's why I was trying to find a school which not just improving my knowledge and skills but also help me be more social.

    <p>
      And DBC is just such a place.They have a different approach to learning. It's not only about build web development skills but also develop essential non-technical skills like empathy, listening, relationship-building, and leadership that will make you invaluable to dynamic, highly collaborative teams.

    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to remember that you cannot just sit back and say "teach me". You must want to learn.
